# gui-for-cli 
A web app which provides user-friendly GUI for programs which doesn't have it 

The purpose of this project is to provide graphical user interface for programs which doesn't have it.
For example let's take curl. Curl doesn't have GUI. This app provides a user interface which allows user 
to select a program to run (curl in this example), then asks for required parameters and optionals(e.g. http method, app should provide drop down list with all available parameters), 
then executes program with specified parameters, then response for program is shown, it is interactive program,
app allows user to respond.

We will add some screenshots when app will be ready :)

## Installation
We will provide installation guid when app will be production ready :)

## Usage
We will also provide some usage informations :)

## Roadmap
Our first target is to provide MVP. 

App should allow interacting with shell in interactive mode and start any new programs by typing their names. Then
should display output.

More detailed features are available on GitHub.

## Contributing
Want to contribute? No problem. You are welcome :) 

If you have some feature suggestions, just open a new one here on GitHub.

When you want to code all you need is to create new branch, clone it.
Then install all dependencies with npm
```npm install``` and then run the project with ```npm run start``` and finished! Angular server is 
listening on port 4200 on localhost.

You will also need to start backend server. It is .NET app, so you will need .NET 6. When you have it, 
jest open the solution and start project. The browser should start automatically on right port.

All environment is set up now. Just start coding!

When you will implement whole feature, make pull request and wait for feedback or accept.
That's all.
